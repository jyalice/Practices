# Some simple practices

# Guess the number

## In this game, you may guess and type in a number between 0 and 100, and your number will be compared with a randomly produced number. If your number is not the produced number, you will be given a clue about if your number is bigger or smaller, and you may guess and type in another number accordingly. This will keep happening until you get the right number. You may type in "e" to end the game and you will see a group of zongzi.

# Produce random boxes

## In this Object Oriented Pragramming (OOP) practice, 10 boxes are randomly produced on the webpage, and their positions and colors keep changing.

## The verification code appears in the blue area, and every time the "new verification code" button is clicked, a new verification code appears. You ought to type the verification code in the box below, and submit it, and then you will be told whether authentification passes or not.
